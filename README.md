Here I have built a portfolio page using HTML and CSS. A portfolio of work where you can see my skills and talents.

You will see the following on the portfolio page:
* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo of myself, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications
* When presented with my first application then that application's image will be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to your viewport
